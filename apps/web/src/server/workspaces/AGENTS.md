# Workspace server modules

These rules apply to `src/server/workspaces/`.

- A flow that hard-deletes a Workspace calls
  `DaemonCredentialRevocations.recordForWorkspace(tx, workspaceId)` inside its
  transaction, before anything revokes or cascades the Workspace's daemon keys
  (only live keys are recorded), and logs the Workspace id with the count it
  returns. That record is the only way a Computer learns its Workspace is gone
  and parks the binding; without it the Computer retries forever. A soft delete
  that keeps the keys valid never parks a Computer.
