# Tasks UI

These rules apply to `src/features/tasks/`.

- Every status edit goes through `executeTask` with claim semantics. The
  browser supplies revisions for the optional revision check; the Agent CLI
  need not.
- dnd-kit owns pointer and keyboard drag mechanics only, never authorization
  or persistence.
- Board and List views share the status-grouped layout and drag interactions
  in this directory. The `/tasks` and conversation routes own the validated
  view search state.
- Overview membership metadata only controls which UI actions are offered;
  the server still authorizes each command.
